# WechatWordCloud
Generating word clouds for WeChat message records.

## To do list
### 1. Get your wechat message database
If you are using iOS device, then you can simply acquire all your message without any encryption by syncing your iphone data to your computer.

On contraire, android and PC users will have encrypted files, and there's some way to crack then, but I can't make it clear in github, for it maybe dangerous for the users.

### 2. Find the sqlite database files and then run the code in the same directory.


## Some tips:

### 1. Do not change the file name of the code easily!
Changing the file name of the code without doing any alternation in the code itself would raise some error in detecting the working directory, I'm still working on solving that problem.

### 2. FOR WIN USERS: Remember to put Chinese font file in your working directory.
And change corresponding code in line 220 and 159 to your desired font.
